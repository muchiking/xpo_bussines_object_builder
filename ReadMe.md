## Setup Instructions

1. **Create a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    ```

2. **Activate the virtual environment:**

    - On Windows:

        ```bash
        .\env\Scripts\Activate.ps1
        ```

    - On Linux/Mac:

        ```bash
        source ./env/bin/activate
        ```

3. **Install the required packages:**

    - Using `requirements.txt`:

        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```

    - Or manually install Flask if that's the only dependency:

        ```bash
        pip install flask
        ```

4. **Run the script:**

    ```bash
    python port.py
    ```
